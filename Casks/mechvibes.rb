  # The app is ad-hoc signed but not notarized, so Gatekeeper refuses to open the
  # quarantined copy Homebrew downloads (a plain double-click is blocked and the
  # user would have to right-click > Open). Clearing the quarantine flag is what
  # that right-click does, once. Only this one app bundle is touched, and the
  # command succeeds whether or not the flag is present.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Mechvibes needs two macOS permissions to hear your keystrokes. Enable it under
    System Settings > Privacy & Security, in both:
      - Accessibility (while its window is focused)
      - Input Monitoring (while it is minimized or another app is in front)

    The app is ad-hoc signed, so after an upgrade macOS can keep showing those
    permissions as on while they have stopped working. If the keys go silent, reset
    them and grant them again:
      tccutil reset Accessibility com.hainguyents13.mechvibes
      tccutil reset ListenEvent com.hainguyents13.mechvibes
  EOS
